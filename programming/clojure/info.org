** Exercise 31 Notes
<2018-02-23 Fri>
my function doesn't work because i don't have a way of comparing the "left hand" and "right hand" of the cons expression. I thought that ~cons~ ing a conditional would work, but it didn't. Alternatively, I could try changing up RTL/LTR evaluation to see if that solves the problem, but I don't think it will.
